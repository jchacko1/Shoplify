## H3 Introduction:
  
  Only a week ago, our team was approached with the idea to create a shopping system, similar to Amazon.com and other e-commerce platforms that would help users manage their online shopping inventory. We will develop a Desktop application in Java which will represent a “shopping cart” where users can add and subtract different items for purchase on their order. Our Shopping system will also support discounts through coupon codes that the user can enter, as well as pickup scheduling to configure when the user would like to receive their order.  

  Users will be able to save their information to a profile page through functionality that will simulate a database. There will also be “Order History” functionality, where a user will be able to see their previous orders. A logged-in user will be able to re-use their previous information in order to speed up the Checkout process. Our shopping system will also support “guest” ordering where a user is not required to log in, in order to complete their order.
 
  As we go forward we might add additional functionality to our shopping system, or refine the functionality that we have planned out so far.
